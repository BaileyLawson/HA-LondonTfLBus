# HA-LondonTfL

WARNING: still under construction and subject to change often

![Departure details from Canning Town Station Platform 4](https://github.com/morosanmihail/HA-LondonTfL/blob/main/images/example.png?raw=true)

Simple Home Assistant sensor to retrieve departures from Transport for London stations.
Each station creates its own sensor.

Just drop into your `custom_components` folder.
After, of course, creating a new folder in there called `london_tfl`, where all the files in this repo will live in.

Sensor state is the next train departure time from the given station.
Attributes contain up to `max` departures.

Demo configuration:

```
sensor:
  - platform: london_tfl
    name: London TfL
    stops:
      - line: dlr  # Required
        station: 940GZZDLRVC  # Required
      - line: dlr
        station: 940GZZDLCGT
        platform: Platform 4  # Optional. All platforms by default
        max: 3  # Optional. 3 items by default
```

Also available is support for the Upcoming Media card.
Random, yes, but it works as a decent visualiser of all upcoming times.

For reference, this also uses `card-mod` to make it look slightly nicer with the less information provided.

    }

    .dlr__fan_fanart {
      background: none !important;
      box-shadow: none !important;
    }
```

Change `dlr__fanart` and `dlr__fan_fanart` as your sensor requires.


TODO:
- Add support as a custom HACS repo
- Explain how to get station codes
- Expand with `/Journey/JourneyResults` API

Known issues:
- Config Flow does not have any form hints. This means you don't actually know what you're filling in. Solved by setting up as a manual sensor or remembering it's `line`, `station`, `max` then `platform` when adding via Integrations.
